Provided actual cost and heuristic information for cities are mentioned in the graph.txt, second_graph.txt.

The Search algortihms implemented are as follows - 
1. Depth 1st search
2. Breadth 1st search
3. Depth-limited search (use depth-limit = 2)
4. Iterative deepening search (show all iterations, not just the iteration that succeeds)
5. Uniform cost search (= Branch-and-bound)
6. Greedy search (= Best 1st search)
7. A*
8. Hill-climbing (use the version of hill-climbing without backtracking)
9. Beam search (use w = 2)
